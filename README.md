# GoxyWelcome

A welcome message plugin for server networks using the Goxy proxy that distinguishes between genuine server joins and internal server transfers.

## Why GoxyWelcome?

Standard welcome plugins show messages on every player connection, creating spam when players move between servers in a network. GoxyWelcome uses the **Goxy API** to detect "full joins" (genuine network connections) vs "server transfers" (moving between servers), only showing welcome messages when appropriate.

## Features

- **üéØ Smart Join Detection** - Uses Goxy API to distinguish full joins from server transfers
- **üí¨ Rich Chat Messages** - Messages with MiniMessage formatting
- **üèÜ Title & Subtitle Display** - Configurable timing and MiniMessage support
- **üîä Sound Effects** - Play sounds on join
- **üìù PlaceholderAPI Support** - Full support for PlaceholderAPI placeholders in all messages
- **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Configuration** - Enable/disable features independently, choose full joins vs all joins

## MiniMessage Formatting

All text uses MiniMessage for rich formatting including colors, gradients, hover effects, and click actions. Test your messages at [webui.advntr.dev](https://webui.advntr.dev).

```yaml
message:
  - "<gradient:red:blue>Welcome {player}!</gradient>"
  - "<rainbow>Enjoy your colorful stay!</rainbow>"
```

## PlaceholderAPI Support

GoxyWelcome supports PlaceholderAPI placeholders in all messages (chat, title, and subtitle). The plugin automatically detects if PlaceholderAPI is installed.

**Available placeholders:**

- `{player}` - Player name (always available)
- Any PlaceholderAPI placeholder (e.g., `%player_displayname%`, `%vault_eco_balance%`) when PlaceholderAPI is installed

```yaml
message:
  - "Welcome back, %player_displayname%!"
  - "Your balance: %vault_eco_balance%"
  - "Online players: %server_online%"
```
