# GoxyWelcome

A welcome message plugin for server networks using the Goxy proxy that distinguishes between genuine server joins and internal server transfers.

## Why GoxyWelcome?

Standard welcome plugins show messages on every player connection, creating spam when players move between servers in a network. GoxyWelcome uses the **Goxy API** to detect "full joins" (genuine network connections) vs "server transfers" (moving between servers), only showing welcome messages when appropriate.

## Features

- **üéØ Smart Join Detection** - Uses Goxy API to distinguish full joins from server transfers
- **üí¨ Rich Chat Messages** - Messages with MiniMessage formatting
- **üèÜ Title & Subtitle Display** - Configurable timing and MiniMessage support
- **üîä Sound Effects** - Play sounds on join
- **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Configuration** - Enable/disable features independently, choose full joins vs all joins

## Prerequisites
